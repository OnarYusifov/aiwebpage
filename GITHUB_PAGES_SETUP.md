# How to Host Your Website on GitHub Pages

## Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Verify Your Repository is Pushed
✅ Your code is already pushed to GitHub at: `https://github.com/OnarYusifov/aiwebpage`

### Step 2: Enable GitHub Pages

1. **Go to your GitHub repository:**
   - Visit: https://github.com/OnarYusifov/aiwebpage

2. **Navigate to Settings:**
   - Click on the **"Settings"** tab (located at the top of your repository page)

3. **Find Pages Section:**
   - Scroll down in the left sidebar
   - Click on **"Pages"** (under "Code and automation")

4. **Configure Source:**
   - Under **"Source"**, select:
     - Branch: **`main`**
     - Folder: **`/ (root)`**
   - Click **"Save"**

5. **Wait for Deployment:**
   - GitHub will build and deploy your site
   - This usually takes 1-2 minutes
   - You'll see a green checkmark when it's ready

### Step 3: Access Your Website

Your website will be live at:
**https://onaryusifov.github.io/aiwebpage/**

### Step 4: Custom Domain (Optional)

If you want to use a custom domain:
1. Go to Pages settings
2. Enter your domain in the "Custom domain" field
3. Update your domain's DNS settings as instructed

## Important Notes

- **File Location**: Make sure `index.html` is in the root directory (✅ it is)
- **Auto-deploy**: Every time you push to the `main` branch, your site will automatically update
- **Build Time**: Changes may take 1-2 minutes to appear on the live site
- **HTTPS**: GitHub Pages automatically provides HTTPS

## Troubleshooting

If your site doesn't load:
1. Check that the branch is set to `main`
2. Verify `index.html` exists in the root
3. Wait a few minutes and refresh
4. Check the Actions tab for any deployment errors

## Your Live URL

Once enabled, your website will be available at:
**https://onaryusifov.github.io/aiwebpage/**
